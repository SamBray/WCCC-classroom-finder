Apps project for CPT 201 at Westmoreland County Community College

The goal is to help students find classrooms by letting them select a building and classroom, then using GPS to determine the entrance they are closest to and displaying a map with the classroom and entrance marked.

This app uses the Corona framework: www.coronalabs.com
